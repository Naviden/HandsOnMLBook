# Artificial Intelligence (AI): A Brief Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. Essentially, AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.

## Types of AI

### 1. **Machine Learning (ML)**
ML is a type of AI that enables a system to learn from data rather than through explicit programming. It involves various approaches and technologies including:

#### a. **Supervised Learning**
Learning from labeled data to make predictions.

#### b. **Unsupervised Learning**
Learning from unlabeled data to identify patterns and structures.

##### c. *There are other types of ML which we won't cover here!*


### 2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
NLP is a technology that enables computers to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way.

### 3. **Robotics**
Robotics involves designing, constructing, operating, and using robots to perform tasks automated by machines, often replicating human actions.

### 4. **Expert Systems**
Expert systems are AI programs that simulate the judgment and behavior of a human or an organization that has expert-level knowledge and experience in a particular field.

### 5. **Rule-Based Systems**
Rule-based systems are a type of AI that use set rules of logic to process data and make decisions. They are particularly useful in fields where clear, definable rules govern the decision-making process.

## Examples of AI in Use

- **Machine Learning:** Spotify uses machine learning to personalize playlists by predicting what music a user will enjoy based on their listening history.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Digital assistants like Amazonâ€™s Alexa use NLP to understand and respond to voice commands.
- **Robotics:** Industrial robots in manufacturing plants are programmed to assemble parts precisely and efficiently.
- **Expert Systems:** The medical diagnosis app, Ada, uses an expert system to provide users with potential diagnoses based on their symptoms.
- **Rule-Based Systems:** Credit scoring systems in financial institutions use rule-based algorithms to assess the creditworthiness of applicants.
